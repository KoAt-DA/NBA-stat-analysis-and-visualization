# NBA Stats Analysis & Visualization

## Project Description

This project allows you to analyze and visualize the performance of NBA players in different teams for various statistics. It uses Python, pandas, and matplotlib to load, filter, and present statistical data visually.

## Features

-Interactive Input: Allows the user to choose a team, specific statistical category (points, assists, rebounds, or true shooting percentage), and the number of top players to visualize.

-Error Handling: Includes error handling for invalid user input (incorrect team abbreviation or stat input) to ensure smooth interaction.

-Data Visualization: Displays a bar chart of the top players in a team for the selected statistic.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.7+**
  To run the project, you'll need to install the following dependencies:

- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`

## Dataset

This project uses the NBA Stats Dataset (all_seasons.csv) from Kaggle which contains player statistics for each season, such as points, rebounds, assists, and more from the 1996-97 season.

## How to use:

Run the Python script to start the interactive analysis and follow the on_screen prompts:

- Input the team abbreviation (e.g., "LAL" for Los Angeles Lakers or ).
- Choose the statistic you'd like to analyze (points, assists, rebounds, or true shooting percentage).
- Enter the number of players you want to display.
- You can see the results in the terminal and a bar chart will be generated showing the top players in the chosen team for the selected statistic.

If desired, you can run multiple searches or exit by typing "no" when prompted.
